**Problem Statement:**
The goal is to create a healthcare website that addresses the unique challenges faced by rural or poor individuals when accessing healthcare services. 


**Key Challenges:**

Lack of accessibility to hospitals and limited knowledge about the kind of illness they might have
Language and Cultural Barriers
Financial Constraints
Limited technical knowledge
Limited Digital Literacy

This website will serve as a platform to bridge the gap between these underserved communities and the healthcare resources they desperately need.


**Solutions:**
Built an ML model which predicts the disease based on the symptoms
Made a multi-lingual website which overcomes the language barrier.
Donations page
Chatbot - providing people with interactive assistance and answering their questions in real-time.
The website has a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. 
        The UI elements are thoughtfully organized and presented in a straightforward manner, allowing users to navigate and interact with the    
        website effortlessly.
        
        
**Methodology:** 

First a simple and  a basic UI was developed.

Then the disease detector model was trained on 4900 records dataset . The trained model was then deployed using Flask API as a communicator between the website and the model.

We created an AI model for a chatbot and trained it on an intentions JSON file, specially created for our website. Flask API was for communication between website and chatbot

 A donations page which uses Stripe API.
